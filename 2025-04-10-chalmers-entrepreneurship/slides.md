What if...


- an economy that prioritised wellbeing for all within the means of the living planet?
- 4 day work week
- 


-->


<!--
Good morning! I'm so excited to meet you, and hope we will have good discussions!


What are the most important things in your life? What makes life meaningful?

What if the economy and society put those things at the center?

I for example, love spending time in nature, running orienteering in the forest and navigating with a map and compass.

vision: prioritera välbefinnande
balans mellan jobb och fritid, sociala aktiviteter



How many of you have heard of Doughnut Economics before? Raise your hands

<h2 class="!text-3xl text-black"><span class="p-2 bg-white bg-opacity-50">Like ripples on water</span></h2>

<!-- Thanks for sharing!

I want to end with this picture.

If there's just one thing you take away from today, let it be that we all are like ripples on water.

Like ripples on water, how we show up in the world and how we act influences the world around us, both in positive and negative ways. However, we are not separate from the world, but interconnected through all our relationships, and with the web of life that makes our lives possible in the first place. We thus also get influenced by the world around us.

With this said, imagine how the world would look like if more people had the conditions to thrive in life while doing good in the world.

Imagine if we could create an economy where organizations were designed to empower and support people so their ripples out into the world could have a positive impact?

Based on what I've learned so far, I'm convinced this is possible. Especially if we co-operate.

So, take a look around you

Think about all our visions for the future

Recognize the potential in this room

Think about all the good things we can make happen in the coming years

Let's choose to tell new stories

Let's create a wellbeing economy, for people and planet
