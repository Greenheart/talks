# Developing a strong inner compass

Helps you evaluate and choose the most relevant opportunities. Be curious, explore, and learn!

<v-click>

**Don't live life fully planned.**

</v-click>
<v-click>

Do choose a clear direction and always try to focus on finishing a few things before moving on. But it's also important to re-evaluate and to choose different paths.

</v-click>
<v-click>

**How to develop a strong inner compass?**

</v-click>
<v-click>

Explore. Have a clear sense of your personal values, visions for the future, and your personal why. We'll get back to this later.

# Key takeaways

<v-click>

<h2 class="pt-6">What worked for me might not work for you.</h2>

<v-click>

## Work together with others!

Build your community, share your progress and celebrate your victories together.

</v-click>
<v-click>

## Sustainability needs to start with yourself.
