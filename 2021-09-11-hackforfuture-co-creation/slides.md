# Finding your way

<v-clicks>

<p class="pt-8">We need to fill life with meaning. Become a conscious agent.</p>

Life is like a river - explore different streams and find what suits you.

The same with entrepreneurship - explore opportunities that come up, but stay focused to make sure you work in the direction you want.

# Developing a strong inner compass

Helps you evaluate and choose the most relevant opportunities. Be curious, explore, and learn!

**Don't live life fully planned.**

</v-click>
<v-click>

Do choose a clear direction and always try to focus on finishing a few things before moving on. But it's also important to re-evaluate and to choose different paths.

</v-click>
<v-click>

**How to develop a strong inner compass?**

</v-click>
<v-click>

Explore. Have a clear sense of your personal values, visions for the future, and your personal why. We'll get back to this later.

- What do I value in life?

- How can I live a good life while also making a good impact on the world around me?
