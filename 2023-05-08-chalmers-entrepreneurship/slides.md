# Key takeaways

<v-click>

<h2 class="pt-6">Sustainability needs to start with yourself</h2>

Before you can widen your circles of compassion to other people or the world, you need to create a life where you can thrive.

</v-click>

<v-click>

<h2>Start where you are</h2>

Keep it simple, experiment, get feedback from people around you, iterate and improve as you learn more.

</v-click>
<v-click>

## Work together with others!

Build your community, share your progress and celebrate your victories together.
